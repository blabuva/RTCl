TITLE Fast mechanism for submembranal Cl- concentration, version 1 (cld1)

COMMENT

    Takes into account:
      - chloride ion accumulation by chloride pump (Lineweaver-Burke equation) 
          and chloride leak
      - radial diffusion
      - longitudinal diffusion
      - extrusion of chloride modelled with a simple exponential

    Diffusion model is modified from Ca diffusion model in Hines & Carnevale: 
    Expanding NEURON with NMODL, Neural Computation 12: 839-851, 2000 
        (Example 8)

    2017-03-12 Modified from cldecay2.mod, but now uses a simple 
                exponential decay for KCC2 as in cldif.mod
    2017-03-15 Made drive_channel & drive_extrusion RANGE variables
    2017-03-15 Added cli1
    2017-03-31 Changed units of tauKCC2 to seconds
    2018-05-09 Changed tabs to spaces and set column width at 80
    2018-05-09 Improved comments
